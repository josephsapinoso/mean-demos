Fundamentals of Passport Authentication
---------------------------------------

Passport is a Node.js middleware that helps to authenticate requests sent to an Express application. 
	- single purpose: authentication
	- "seperation of concerns"
	- extremely easy to integrate into an application
	- Passport authenticates requests through an extensible set of plugins known as "strategies"



Strategies

	- Local --> Passport-local 
		- This strategy involves authenticating users through a username and password

	- OpenID --> Passport-openid
		- open standard for federated authentication (see below for def.)
		- In this strategy, users present an OpenID to sign in to a website after choosing an OpenID Provider...
		- The provider issues an assertion to confirm the user's id, and the website verifies this assertion to sign in user.

	- Oauth --> Passport-oauth
		- Enables authentication through Oauth Authentication provides such as Twitter, Facebook and Google


"federated authentication":
Federated Identity (FID) refers to where the user stores their credentials. Alternatively, FID can be viewed as a way to connect Identity Management systems together. In FID, a user's credentials are always stored with the "home" organization (the "identity provider").
