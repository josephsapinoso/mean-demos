It's time to put our knowledge to work!

We will now create teh AngularJS frontend for an application that allows users to post and view details - such as Title, Venue, and date - about events.

- Create a RESTful API to handle GET and POST requests for event details using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 

- Finally, we will integrate the frontend with the backend
