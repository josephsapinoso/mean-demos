Middleware:

A middleware function has access to:
	1. the request object (req)
	2. the response object (res)
	3. the next middlware in sequence (next)

A middlware must either:
	1. End the request-response cyle by using res.end()
	2. Call next() to invoke the next middlware

Besides the middlware that you create, some built-in middleware and third-party middleware are also available.

In this demo, we have learned how to define and register middleware.
