The Key Features of MongoDB:

- MongoDB is an open-source document database
- provides high performance, high availability, and easy scaling
- a MongoDB deployment can hold a number of databases
- a database in MongoDB is a set of collections
- a collection is a set of documents 
- a document is a record, which is composed of key-value pairs 

- MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects 
- The fields in a document may include arrays, other documents, and arrays of documents
	- ex. {
		name: "Helen",
		age: 26,
		hobbies: ['singing', 'reading']	
	}

- MongoDB supports a dynamic schema
	- no well-defined model of which data is stored in the database 
	- varying sets of fields and different data types for the fields

- Advantages:
	- storing data in form of objects provides better synergy between database and application.
	- Embedded documents and arrays reduce the need to create joins
	- The schemaless nature of MongoDB is an ideal match for the constantly evolving data structures in Web applications
	- The data types supported by MongoDB are very similar to native JS data types.
