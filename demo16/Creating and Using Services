Creating and Using Service
--------------------------

- Services are used to organize and share code across an app

	- "Controller 1" & "Controller 2" share "User Service 1"
	- The logic to fetch data could be included in a service
	- Angular has predefined services:
		- $http
		- $route
	- You can also create custom services to organize and reuse code

- In this lesson, we will focus on creating a custom service. In this case, it will be the factory() method. 

- ex:

var app = angular.module('myapp', []);
	
	app.factory('userService', function(){ // the service
	
		var factory = {}; // creates an object
	
		factory.getUsers = function () { // populates it with an array of users
			factory.Users = ['Anna', 'Tom', 'Jill];
			return (factory.Users);	
		}	
		return factory; // returns the object 
	});

	- The service simply creates an object, populates it with an array containing the names of users and then returns the object. 

- Notice that the above service requires no dependency; however, we may need to create services that need dependencies. 

	- We can apply this method as a dependency to inject in controllers. 

	-ex. To use this service we just created:

		app.controller('userCtrl', function($scope, userService) // declare the name of the service as a dependency of the controller
		{
			$scope.names = userService.getUsers(); // call the service 
		});


- In this topic we learned about creating and using services
